# Shopware 6 production template

This repository contains the production template that enables you to build,
package and deploy Shopware 6 to production shops. This template is also used
to build the official packages distributed by shopware at [https://www.shopware.com/en/download](https://www.shopware.com/en/download).

This template is optimized for production usage and contains basic development tooling. 
It's intended as a basis for project customizations, which are usually done by agencies.

If you want to contribute to the [Shopware Platform](https://github.com/shopware/platform) or develop store plugins, 
you should use the [development template](https://github.com/shopware/development).

## Branches and stability

In each commit a composer.lock is contained to ensure that the version being
deployed is the version that was tested in our CI. We currently provide two
branches:
- `6.1`: stable patch releases (`v6.1.*`)
- `6.2`: stable patch releases (`v6.2.*`)
- `master`: stable minor+patch releases (`v6.1.3`, `v6.1.15`, `v6.2.0`, `v6.3.0`, ...)

Stable patch releases are stable and only get non-breaking bug fixes. (security issues are an exception).

The `master` branch contains the newest stable minor release. That may result in plugins being incompatible, so be careful.

## Requirements

See [https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/system-guide/system-requirements](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/system-guide/system-requirements)

NPM and Node are only required during the build process and for development. If you don't have javascript customizations, it's not required at all. Because the storefront and admin are pre-build.

If you are using a separate build server, consider having NPM and Node as build-only requirements. Your operating application server doesn't require any of these to run Shopware 6.

## Setup and install

To setup the environment and install with a basic setup run the following commands:

```bash
# clone newest 6.2 patch version from github 
git clone --branch=6.2 https://github.com/shopware/production shopware
cd shopware

# install shopware and dependencies according to the composer.lock 
composer install

# setup the environment
bin/console system:setup
# or create .env yourself, if you need more control
# create jwt secret: bin/console system:generate-jwt-secret
# create app secret: APP_SECRET=$(bin/console system:generate-app-secret)
# create .env

# create database with a basic setup (admin user and storefront sales channel)
bin/console system:install --create-database --basic-setup

# or use the interactive installer in the browser: /recovery/install/index.php
```

## Update

To update Shopware 6 just run this:

```bash
# pull newest changes from origin
git pull origin

# the (pre|post)-(install|update)-cmd will execute all steps automatically
composer install
```

# Customization

This project is called production template because it can be used to 
create project specific configurations. The template provides a basic setup
that is equivalent to the official distribution. If you need customization,
the workflow could look like this:
* Fork template
* Make customization
* Add dependencies
* Add project specific plugins
* Update var/plugins.json (bin/console bundle:dump, paths need to be relative to the project root)
* Build administration/storefront
* Update composer.json and composer.lock
* Commit changes

## Development

## Managing Dependencies

### Composer

You only need to require the things you want. If you only want to run shopware 6 in headless mode, your composer.json could look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "acme/shopware-production",
    "type": "project",
    "license": "MIT",
    "config": {
        "optimize-autoloader": true
    },
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "minimum-stability": "stable",
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Shopware\\Production\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "require": {
        "php": "~7.2",
        "ocramius/package-versions": "1.4.0",
        "shopware/core": "~v6.1.0"
    }
}
```

### Require project plugins

If you have project specific plugins, place them under `custom/static-plugins/{YourPlugin}` and require them in your `composer.json`.

Note: The plugins needs a (stable) version to work with the default stability `stable`.

```bash
composer require "exampleorg/myplugin"
```

External plugins in private repositories can also be required by adding the repository to your composer.json.

See [Using private repositories](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#using-private-repositories)

### Update shopware packages

Run the following command, to update all shopware dependencies:
```bash
composer update "shopware/*"
```

# Deployment

## Docker

The `DOCKERFILE` and docker-compose.yml service definitions should work but are still experimental.


## Storage and caches

The following directories should be shared by all app servers:

```txt
.
├── config
│   ├── jwt # ro - should be written on first deployment
│   ├── secrets # rw shared - see, if you want to use it: https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-4-4-encrypted-secrets-management 
├── public
│   ├── bundles # rw shared - Written by `assets:install` / `theme:compile`, can also be initiated by the administration
│   ├── media # rw shared
│   ├── theme # rw shared - generated themes by `theme:compile/change`
│   └── thumbnail # rw shared - media thumbnails
│   └── sitemap # rw shared - generated sitemaps
├── var
│   ├── cache # rw local - contains the containers, which contains additional cache directories (twig, translations, etc)
│   ├── log # a - append only, can be change in the monlog config

ro - Readonly after deployment
rw shared - read and write access, it should be shared across the app servers
rw local - locale read and write access
```

Some of these directories like `public` can also be changed to different flysystem to host the files on s3 for example.
